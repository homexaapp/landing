            <h1>About HomeXa</h1>
            <p>At the heart of real estate is relationships. Every transaction is more than a closing—it’s a chance to earn trust, inspire loyalty, and become the expert your clients confidently refer to friends, family, and colleagues.</p>
            <p>But let’s be honest: we’ve all been in <em>that</em> moment.</p>
            <p>You’re standing in front of a furnace, and your client asks:</p>
            <p><q>How old is this unit?</q></p>
            <p>You squint at a worn-out label that might as well be written in ancient Latin, and after an awkward pause, you say, “Let me check with the listing agent.”</p>
            <p>In today’s world of instant answers, that pause is a problem.</p>
            <p>That’s where <strong>HomeXa</strong> comes in.</p>
            <p>With a quick scan, the app instantly deciphers appliance tags—returning over 20 key data points on furnaces, A/C units, water heaters, and more. Then, in seconds, you can generate a sleek, branded report to impress your clients and keep your name top of mind.</p>
            <h2>HomeXa: Be the most informed agent in the room.</h2>
            <p>Because trust isn’t built by chance—it’s built by being prepared.</p>
