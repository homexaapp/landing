            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information HomeXa collects, how we use it, with whom we share it, how long we keep it, and how you can exercise your rights.</p>

            <h2>Short summary</h2>
            <p>We only collect the <b>personal information you provide when creating an account</b> (for example: name, email, and any other fields required to register). We do not collect additional personal information from you during normal app use.</p>

            <h2>What we collect</h2>
            <p><b>Account information</b> you provide during sign-up, such as your name, email address, and any other required registration fields. You may optionally provide additional profile information; we only store what you explicitly submit.</p>

            <h2>How we use your information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To create, authenticate, and manage your account.</li>
                <li>To provide, operate, and improve the app features tied to your account.</li>
                <li>To communicate with you regarding account-related matters and support requests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sharing and disclosure</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.</li>
                <li>We may share limited account data with <b>trusted third-party service providers</b> who perform services on our behalf (for example: authentication, hosting, backups). Those providers are contractually required to protect your information and use it only to perform services for us.</li>
                <li>We may disclose information when required by law or to protect our rights, safety, or property.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data retention</h2>
            <p>We retain account information for as long as your account is active and as otherwise necessary to provide the service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
            <p>If you ask us to delete your account, we will remove your personal information from our active systems within a reasonable timeframe except where retention is required by law.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information. We regularly review our security practices, but no security measure can guarantee absolute protection.</p>

            <h2>Your rights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Access:</b> You may request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</li>
                <li><b>Correction:</b> You may request correction of inaccurate or incomplete information.</li>
                <li><b>Deletion:</b> You may request deletion of your account and associated personal data; note that deletion may result in loss of access to account-based features.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To make any of the above requests, contact us at the address below. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests.</p>

            <h2>Children</h2>
            <p>The app is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete the information.</p>

            <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy in the app and update the "last-updated" date at the top.</p>

            <h2>Legal note</h2>
            <p>This policy is intended to describe our practices succinctly. For legal compliance and jurisdiction-specific requirements, consult legal counsel and update this policy accordingly.</p>
